  "I had a friend who once owned a Ford Focus that he was really fond of.  He even went so far as to name it “Skye” because of it was painted a light blue color.  One day after catching a movie at the theater we got out into the parking lot just in time to see some burly guys with long blonde hair tossing the tires into the back of their pickup truck.  I was about take off after them when he stopped me and said, “There’s nothing we can do.  Skye’s rims belong to the Nords.”",
